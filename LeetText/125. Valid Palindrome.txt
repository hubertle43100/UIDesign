== 125. Valid Palindrome ==

== Strategy ==

- Make the string into an array
- Set start & end pointer to the beginning & ending index of the string array
- Alphanumeric: the character is either a number or letter

	(Example)
	RACECAR
	^     ^		--> Start and end pointers will move closer each other
	S     E		   

	RACECAR
	 ^   ^		--> After every loop and if the loop doesn't break 
	 S   E		    then return true

	RACECAR
	  ^ ^		
	  S E		    
			    
 
== Code == 

	(Example)
	RACE, CAR!
	^        ^	--> if there is a non Alphanumeric character pointer moves
	S        E	    inwards (E in this case would decrement -1)

	RACE, CAR!
	^       ^	--> Start comparison
	S       E
