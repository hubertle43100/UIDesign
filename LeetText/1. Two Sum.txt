enumerated: is list out things one by one

	var dict = [Int:Int]() 
		--> Created a dictionary to store the relationship 
		    between value and index

	for (index,num) in nums.enumerated(){...}

		--> for loop is taking the index and number &
		    looks for a value in the array of diff &
		    return the index of the diff value if found otherwise
		    just set number value to its own index
