	== Strategy ==

	O(log n) 	--> binary search
	Sorted array 	--> binary search

	Binary search: to find the midpoint within each loop until 
		       it narrows down the options/search
 
	== Code ==
	
	!!! let mid = (end-start)/2
	--> Could cause integer overflow (try to create number that is out of range)

	âœ“ let mid = start + (end-start)/2


	(Example)	s = start || e = end || m = mid

	[1,3,5,6]	target = 5
	 ^ ^   ^ 
	 s m   e	--> Since m is less than 5 then we iterate(m+1) for s

	[1,3,5,6]
	     ^ ^ 
	    sm e 	--> s & m share same index because s=m+1
